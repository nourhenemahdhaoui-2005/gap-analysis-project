## 1. Introduction
This report presents a basic security gap analysis performed on a Kali Linux system using an automated analysis script.

---

## 2. System Information
- OS: Kali GNU/Linux Rolling 2025.3
- Kernel: 6.12.38
- Analysis Tool: gap-analysis-checks.sh

---

## 3. Identified Security Gaps

### 3.1 Weak Password Policy
The system does not enforce strong password complexity requirements, making it vulnerable to brute-force and dictionary attacks.

**Recommended Fix:**  
Configure pwquality to enforce stronger passwords.

---

### 3.2 Firewall Not Installed
The system does not have an active firewall, exposing it to unauthorized network access.

**Recommended Fix:**  
Install and enable UFW with restrictive default rules.

---

### 3.3 SSH Root Login Configuration
Root login over SSH is not explicitly disabled, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.

**Recommended Fix:**  
Disable root login in SSH configuration.

---

### 3.4 Unnecessary Enabled Services
Multiple services are enabled by default, increasing the system attack surface.

**Recommended Fix:**  
Disable unused services.

---

### 3.5 System Updates Not Verified
The system update status is unclear, potentially leaving known vulnerabilities unpatched.

**Recommended Fix:**  
Update all system packages regularly.

---

## 4. Remediation Summary
All identified gaps were addressed by applying security best practices such as enforcing strong passwords, enabling a firewall, securing SSH access, and updating the system.

---

## 5. Conclusion
This gap analysis highlights the importance of proper system hardening. Applying the recommended fixes significantly improves the overall security posture of the system.
